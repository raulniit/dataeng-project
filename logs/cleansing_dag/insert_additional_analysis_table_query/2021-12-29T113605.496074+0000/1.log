The full joke introduces the question, "Why do they call it the Xbox 360?" with the answer "Because when you see it, you''ll turn 360 degrees and walk away." The punchline is intentionally nonsensical because 360 degrees is a complete circle, meaning if you turn 360 degrees, you''ll end up facing the same direction as before. When Microsoft revealed the name of their new console, some people were confused why they called it the "Xbox 360" instead of the "Xbox 2," so whenever anyone asks why this name was chosen, it''s common for people familiar with the meme to reply with its punchline. Coinciding with the release of the console, the meme was popularized in 2006 and frequently used until dying off around 2014 with the next-gen Xbox One.', '[Album Organisation Song Company MusicalWork Work Agent]', '[Organization MusicRecording MusicAlbum CreativeWork]');

He underwent different experiments which cured his cancer, gave him an extraordinarily fast healing-factor (faster than Wolverine''s), but cost him his sanity and left his entire body horribly disfigured. He was captive of Weapon X for many years until he managed to escape. He decided to return to the mercenary business using his healing powers as an advantage over competition, creating his own costume similar to those of the superheroes in comic books.[2] In his first appearances, Deadpool’s character was framed as unflappable and wise-cracking, always expecting violence, with money as his main motivation in life. Over the years, he has been depicted as insane with extreme moments of angst, bitterness and self-loathing. He has an extremely characteristic voice, and it is said to be very annoying by many characters, which along his wise-cracking personality makes him a very irritating person to be with.[3] He developed an absurd sense of humor and an awareness of being a comic book character, often breaking the "fourth wall" and talking directly to the reader.', '[EthnicGroup ComicsCharacter ComicsCreator Disease Organisation

Minnesotan documentary filmmaker and general pants enthusiast Chuck Olsen announced his first Pants Status via Twitter in 2006. KYM recently caught up with Chuck to find out some more details. KYM: Do you remember the first time you tweeted your pants status? Chuck: I don''t remember the first time I tweeted my pants status. Sadly, Twitter doesn''t let us go back to the beginning of my timeline. The oldest I''m allowed to see is this in Aug 2007: Pants status: Recently frozen. But I''m sure I had plenty of pants status action in 2006. I''ve attached a couple tweets where I tried to get Xeni Jardin''s attention with the power of Pants Status (unsuccessfully.) [see pictures section below] KYM: What motivated you to tweet your pants status? Chuck: I just found it funny, was bored and wanted to think of something new to do with twitter. People have asked me what it''s about, but I try not to define it. One hand clapping kinda thing. KYM: When did you first notice others tweeting their pants status? Chuck: I''ve sometimes seen friends on Twitter do a pants status over the last couple of years. There was one day recently when @Sockington the cat and @anamariecox did a pants status on the same day and I thought, "OMG, Pants Status just jumped the shark." Craig Newmark mentioned it too. Bre Pettis made pantsstatus.com some time ago and sent me the link, which I thought was cool but I stopped paying attention to it. Until recently I was oblivious to Bre''s blog post promoting pants status as "what you tweet when someone leaves their phone unattended." Bre is good at creating and pushing memes. For the record, I think Pants Status is much more cosmic / less specific than that narrow definition, but it''s a fun way to use it. KYM: Why no #hashtag? Chuck: I never used a hashtag because I don''t think hashtags were used that much yet when I first started Pants Statussing. At least, I wasn''t in the habit of using them.', '[Website Writer Organisation Person Work Software Agent]', '[Organization WebSite Person CreativeWork]');
