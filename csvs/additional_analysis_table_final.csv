Deadpool was a Canadian soldier and mercenary who joined the mysterious organization Weapon X after being diagnosed with cancer. He underwent different experiments which cured his cancer, gave him an extraordinarily fast healing-factor (faster than Wolverine's), but cost him his sanity and left his entire body horribly disfigured. He was captive of Weapon X for many years until he managed to escape. He decided to return to the mercenary business using his healing powers as an advantage over competition, creating his own costume similar to those of the superheroes in comic books.[2] In his first appearances, Deadpool’s character was framed as unflappable and wise-cracking, always expecting violence, with money as his main motivation in life. Over the years, he has been depicted as insane with extreme moments of angst, bitterness and self-loathing. He has an extremely characteristic voice, and it is said to be very annoying by many characters, which along his wise-cracking personality makes him a very irritating person to be with.[3] He developed an absurd sense of humor and an awareness of being a comic book character, often breaking the ""fourth wall"" and talking directly to the reader.","Agent,,Organisation,,EthnicGroup,,FictionalCharacter,,Company,,Disease,,Artist,,ComicsCharacter,,Person,,ComicsCreator,,Publisher,","Organization,,Person,"

"Everybody Walk the Dinosaur","Everybody Walk The Dinosaur is a copypasta meme originating from 4chan. The point of it is to be telling a really raunchy or interesting story and then abruptly end it with “OPEN THE DOOR / GET ON THE FLOOR /EVERYBODY WALK THE DINOSAUR.” Thus, the expectant reader is trolled by the lack of a climax to what could have been full of win. The preceding lines are the (incredibly catchy)[citation needed] chorus of the song “Walk the Dinosaur” by the band Was (Not Was). A number of other artists have done covers of the song, the most notable of which are by George Clinton for the Super Mario Bros movie and Queen Latifah for Ice Age 3. It is possible that this is one of the reasons that this phrase became so popular.

Dogfort started as a monophonic broadcast, like memorable journalism photographs – it had just one panel, all the story was told in the capture of that one moment in time. The expansion from one frame into multi-panel graphic art is the result of the imagination honey trap that the original single panel, dogfort frame offered. this time dogfort leans on comic book artwork, and film. Using perspective to encourage user reaction. A trademark of dogfort is the wide angle, then close up of the subject to invoke a more sustained emotional response. While dogfort lends itself to traditional memes in that each comic crudely put together, dogfort has (for now) remained free of the shackles of most internet memes, it's accessible for a wider audience because despite the odd F-word it's stuff that even your mom could look at and go ""D'aaawwww"". It's also escaped the probable punchline, like FUUUU, you instantly recognise the style and know what's coming, you don't get that with dogfort. You are required to read the story in order to get the LoLs, and they could be anywhere between the start and end frames.. dogfort is no longer just a visual meme, it's a style.

On February 10th, ReadWriteWeb published a story called ""Facebook Wants to Be Your One True Login"" detailing the recent announcment that Facebook was partnering with AOL to tie together the popular social networking site with AOL instant Messenger. Many (see: noobs) who use Google for everything, rather than bookmarking sites or typing URLs in the address bar, Googled ""Facebook login"" and found the ReadWriteWeb article. Those users seemed to be under the false impression that ReadWriteWeb was the new Facebook, mistaking RWW's Facebook Connect integration for being a part of Facebook itself, and were enraged at their inability to access their Facebook pages directly from RWW. Interspersed with each instance of genuine rage came sarcastic remarks WRITTEN IN ALL CAPS with the seemingly mandatory speling erors that are included whenever writing the typical lolspeak.

Minnesotan documentary filmmaker and general pants enthusiast Chuck Olsen announced his first Pants Status via Twitter in 2006. KYM recently caught up with Chuck to find out some more details. KYM: Do you remember the first time you tweeted your pants status? Chuck: I don't remember the first time I tweeted my pants status. Sadly, Twitter doesn't let us go back to the beginning of my timeline. The oldest I'm allowed to see is this in Aug 2007: Pants status: Recently frozen. But I'm sure I had plenty of pants status action in 2006. I've attached a couple tweets where I tried to get Xeni Jardin's attention with the power of Pants Status (unsuccessfully.) [see pictures section below] KYM: What motivated you to tweet your pants status? Chuck: I just found it funny, was bored and wanted to think of something new to do with twitter. People have asked me what it's about, but I try not to define it. One hand clapping kinda thing. KYM: When did you first notice others tweeting their pants status? Chuck: I've sometimes seen friends on Twitter do a pants status over the last couple of years. There was one day recently when @Sockington the cat and @anamariecox did a pants status on the same day and I thought, ""OMG, Pants Status just jumped the shark."" Craig Newmark mentioned it too. Bre Pettis made pantsstatus.com some time ago and sent me the link, which I thought was cool but I stopped paying attention to it. Until recently I was oblivious to Bre's blog post promoting pants status as ""what you tweet when someone leaves their phone unattended."" Bre is good at creating and pushing memes. For the record, I think Pants Status is much more cosmic / less specific than that narrow definition, but it's a fun way to use it. KYM: Why no #hashtag? Chuck: I never used a hashtag because I don't think hashtags were used that much yet when I first started Pants Statussing. At least, I wasn't in the habit of using them.","Work,,Agent,,Organisation,,Writer,,Software,,Person,,Website,","Organization,,Person,,WebSite,,CreativeWork,"
